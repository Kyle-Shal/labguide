# Welcome

Welcome to the Built Environment and Active Populations (BEAP) Lab. Great to have you. Below you will find lots of information and readings about the lab. Take some time to read the linked documents and get oriented. If you have questions don't hesitate to ask. 

### Our vision is 

> A physically active Canadian population

### Our mission is  

> To conduct research that will help design urban environments that equitably increase physical activity for the entire population

### Our motto is  

> "On se dit les vraies choses" [Marianne Beaulieu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marianne-beaulieu-4b358866). The quote is from one of my dear friends and PhD colleagues. 

Which I translate to mean

> We provide positive critcism and work honestly to do the best possible research.
