## RStudio + Github Orientation

This orientation is for new people in the Walkabilly lab who are familiar with R and RStudio but do not have experience with Github or the Walkabillylab organization. This tutorial assumes you are already familiar with R and RStudio. If you are not familiar with R and R Studio I recommnded this tutorial [https://github.com/AmeliaMN/IntroToR](https://github.com/AmeliaMN/IntroToR) by [Amelia McNamara](https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN). There are 2 parts to the orientation: 

1. Connect with Github
2. GIF
3. Analysis

## Connect with Github

1. Create a Github account [https://github.com](https://github.com)

2. Follow the tutorial developed by [Jenny Bryan](https://twitter.com/jennybryan) and here team at [http://happygitwithr.com/](http://happygitwithr.com/). This tutorial will have creating your first repository and connecting your RStudio session with a Github Repository. Once you have completed the tutorial, move on to step 3. 

3. Request access to the [Walkabilly Lab Organization](https://github.com/walkabillylab)

## Analysis and GIF

You are now familiar with how to connect RStudio with Github. It's time to practice your skills. 

### GIF

1. Your task here is to post your name and an animated GIF that represents your experience with this tutorial to the [gif](https://github.com/walkabillylab/gif) repository in the Walkabilly Lab organization. Something like this:

For this you will need to use your RMarkdown skills. A GIF is really just an image so you can use the `![Text](URL)` code to insert the image of your GIF. Make sure to copy the GIF image from Giphy or another site. 

### Analysis

The second task is to conduct a simple analysis using an existing dataset from the lab. 

1. Create a new repository in the Walkabilly Lab Organization. Give your repository a meaningful name that you will remember.

2. Log into the lab server and find the data in `/blah/blah/data.csv`

3. Create a new project linking the repository with an RStudio project (like you did in tutorial). Conduct an analysis of the data. Make sure to commit your changes before each new task. The analysis should include the following: 
    3.1 A scatter plot of the `x` and `y` variables
    3.2 The mean and standard deviation of the `x` and `y` variables

4. Push the changes and check to see that they are online.
