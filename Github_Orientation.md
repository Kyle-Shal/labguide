## RStudio + Github Orientation

This orientation is for new people in the Walkabilly lab who are familiar with R and RStudio but do not have experience with Github or the Walkabillylab organization. This tutorial assumes you are already familiar with R and RStudio. If you are not familiar with R and R Studio I recommnded this tutorial [https://github.com/AmeliaMN/IntroToR](https://github.com/AmeliaMN/IntroToR) by [Amelia McNamara](https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN). There are 2 parts to the orientation: 

1. Connect with Github
2. GIF and Analysis

## Connect with Github

1. Create a Github account [https://github.com](https://github.com)

2. Follow the tutorial developed by [Jenny Bryan](https://twitter.com/jennybryan) and here team at [http://happygitwithr.com/](http://happygitwithr.com/). This tutorial will have creating your first repository and connecting your RStudio session with a Github Repository. Once you have completed the tutorial, move on to step 3. 

3. Request access to the [Walkabilly Lab Organization](https://github.com/walkabillylab)
